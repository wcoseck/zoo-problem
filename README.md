        <h2>Giraffes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Frankie</li>
          <p>
            Frankie is our oldest Giraffe, he is 20 years old and he enjoys just
            chilling and eating grass. He eats 2 times a day due to his age,
            won't be hard to miss because his walk is somewhat slow.
          </p>
          <li>Coconut</li>
          <p>
            Coconut is pretty tiny in size, she is just a baby currently and you
            will have to manually feed her 3-4 times a day through a bottle. Her
            stripes bend a particular way, she is somewhat active and likes
            jumping around.
          </p>

        <h2>Lions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Mella</li>
          <p>
            Mella takes long naps throughout the day, then walks around in
            circles around the zoo cage, she is somewhat aggressive, hence, when
            you feed her try to keep away, and feed her 3 times a day.
          </p>
          <li>Karl</li>
          <p>
            Karl is our most active lion, he is the leader of the group and he
            likes to swing at you a bit while you feed him. Since he is very
            active try feeding him 4-5 times with large pieces of meat.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cookie will always try looking for you when it's meal time, she'll
            try playing with you all the time and will be the loudest and the
            one always swinging around. Feed 2 times per day.

          </p>

      <!--Division 5. with giraffe as the second animal to explain-->
      <div>
        <h2>Alligators</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Wren</li>
          <p>
            Wren the alligator is from Florida! He likes to take long swims in
            the lake that we have and likes to bite people around, so he is a
            little closed off from the rest, he enjoys 2-3 meals a day, and
            likes to play with his food. He is missing 3 toes from his left
            food, so you'll recognize him.
          </p>
          <li>Aspen</li>
          <p>
            Aspen is very slow, he is also very grumpy, so he likes his meals to
            be set close to him but won't interact with you at all. He likes his
            own space and you'll never see him playing with the rest. He likes
            to be fed 2 times a day.
          </p>
          <li>Mika</li>
          <p>
            Mika is always with another alligators, he likes being in a pair
            with someone else, he is always next to someone and he enjoys eating
            next to them as well, so feed both at the same time. Feed 3-4 times
            a day.
          </p>
        </ul>
